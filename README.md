## Character Vault

This "vault bot" enables a party to enable an approval concept of Dungeons and Dragons characters from [DND Beyond](https://dndbeyond.com/my-characters) (or 'stub' characters not on dndbeyond using the `!register manual` command) and the changes they make to them via [Discord](https://discordapp.com).  This allows a (or multiple) DMs to ensure that the character changes that a user makes on [DND Beyond](https://dndbeyond.com/my-characters) are accurate for their campaigns.

The primary driver for this functionality was watching so many DM/GMs trying to manage [West Marches](http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/) type Discord servers using spreadsheets/etc.  The bot works great for "non" West Marches type campaigns as well!  This can make things a bit easier to maintain for online Dungeons and Dragons players and DMs.

Approval functionality is configured 'false' by default, enable it by running `!config approval true`.

## Events

The bot also offers the ability to schedule events (missions) and allow attendees (party members) to sign up for attendance, or remove themselves from attendance.  The bot will also convert the default time (GMT) to the user's local timezone upon request via the clock reaction on the event.  Events can be 'deployed' to show that they are 'approved' and have all the proper components (DM/GM, attendees, etc).

Event campaign enforcement is configured off ('false') by default.  Turning it on ensures that the players that sign up for an event have a 'character' in the vault that is also related to the event's campaign (if set) via `!campaign` or a dndbeyond's campaign).  Turn this on by issuing `!config campaign true`

Users have the ability to list events that are deployed or proposed (not yet approved/deployed).

### Subscribe to the calendar

Once a user signs up as an attendee, or creates an event, those events will show up in that user's ICS feed.  The user can subscribe to the ICS feed within Outlook, Google Calendar, iCal, etc.  When a user clicks on the 'Timezone' button, a message is sent to them with their local timezone as well as a link to their personalized ICS calendar link.

</div>

## Polling

Users can create polls very simply by using the `poll` command.  `!poll "Do you like polling"` will create a default poll that has three options:  üëç (yes) üëé (no) and ü§∑ (I don't know).  A user can also create his own options, which will be automatically numbered by using this syntax: `!poll "Do you like polling" "hell no" "I LOVE polling" "What is polling?"`.

## Rolling dice

Users can roll dice by using the `roll` command.  The dice roller uses [notation](https://greenimp.github.io/rpg-dice-roller/guide/notation/).

### Die quantity

- A single die has a minimum quantity of 1, and a maximum quantity of 999.
- These are valid: d8, 1d10, 999d6, 20d4 + 999d10
- These are not: 0d10, 1000d6, -1d20

### Example usages

```diff
roll 2 20 sided dice
!roll 2d20

roll 8 20 sided dice and drop the lowest 1
!roll 8d20dl1

values less than 3 are treated as 3
!roll 4d6min3

values greater than 3 are treated as 3
!roll 4d6max3

reroll dice if a 1 is rolled
!roll 1d6r

reroll dice if one is less than 3
!roll 1d6r<3

roll 4 100 sided dice
!roll 4d100

above is the same as rolling percentile dice
!roll 4d%

roll 4 fudge dice
!roll 4dF

```

## Feedback and Support Discord

I'm looking for feedback, so please feel free to open bugs, feature requests, etc.  As well as hop on my discord for direct conversation.  [Join me on this discord for support](https://discord.gg/ueCkbQgxrF)

## Invite the BOT to your server

[Invite the bot to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=792843392664993833&permissions=223296&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

## Example character workflow with the BOT

Workflow would work something like this.

- Discord users join a server and decide to have a campaign.
- Server owner invites BOT
- Each user creates a character for campaign on [DND Beyond](https://dndbeyond.com/my-characters)
- Each user 'registers' character with BOT
- DM 'approves' each character
- Mission occurs
- Users update characters on [DND Beyond](https://dndbeyond.com/my-characters)
- Users request 'update' of character with BOT
- DM 'lists queued' character approvals
- DM reviews 'changes' of character
- DM 'approves' character changes

all the while anyone on the server can 'view' any user's character ...

## Example character workflow usage with approvals 'true'

```diff
#player types
!register https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/BlacknTan/characters/41867999
#approver role user types
!list queued
!changes 41867999
!approve 41867999
#player types, to update character
!update https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/BlacknTan/characters/41867999
#approver role user types
!list queued
!changes 41867999
!approve 41867999
```
